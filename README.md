# doubleStopwatch
by Jeremiah Mullane 2018-2019

This app provides a simple function: it is a single screen app that allows two stopwatches to run on your device simultaneously.
It mimics the look and feel of Apple's default Stopwatch app fairly closely.

Currently, Lap functionality works via the console. Display of lap data via UITableView is a work-in-progress.
This app was originally designed to be used on an iPhoneSE. It may be used on larger devices, but spacing may be artificially constrained.
